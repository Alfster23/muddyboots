<p>

I am able to offer various dog walks in the Haywards Heath and surrounding area and I am careful to choose locations which are safe but also offer variety and stimulation for your dog.<br><br>

I walk a maximum of 3 client’s dogs at a time which ensures dogs are well exercised but also have plenty of 1:1 attention. This is safer and less stressful for your pet as large groups of dogs can create a ‘pack’ mentality; not always ideal for your dog or other walkers that we come across. Additionally this means that dogs spend less time being transported, particularly important during hot weather.<br><br>

As well as small group walks I can also arrange individual walks if required. As much as possible I will arrange walks which are close to your home to minimise the time spent in a vehicle both for the benefit or your dog as well as the environment.<br><br>

In addition to dog walking I can offer puppy or dog visits as well as cat or small animal feeding.
